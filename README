Hello and Welcome to OpenBook
=============================
* What is OpenBook ?
OpenBook is a jazz real book constructed with free software. A real book simply means a big book with lots of jazz tunes or standards as they are more widely known.

* Why did you start this ?
Because of many reasons:
- I wanted to learn jazz and a good way to do that is to write down the tunes (amongst many many other things).
- I wanted beautiful sheet music that I could fiddle with.
- I did not want to pay for the overly expensive real or fake books out there.
- I believe in free software and wanted free (in the sense of freedom) sheet music.
- Jazz is a prime example of a free type of art so it's conjunction with free software seems a match made in heaven.

* What tools are used ?
lilypond, m4, make, perl, lame, timidity, gpp, cpp and possibly more.

* What is produced ?
A postscript and PDF real book with Jazz tunes.
In addition you can produce midi, mp3, ogg outputs.
Possibly other output formats will be supported in the future (epub?).

* What is the copyright ?
All the stuff in this project is GPL version 3. The tunes themselves have their own copyright holders.

* Who can contribute ?
Anyone.

* What system do I need to participate ?
A Linux system that you can install software on.
Windows is not currently supported although well formed patches will be accepted.

* What do I need to know to participate ?
Some rudimentary Linux system administration (in order to install the software needed for this project to build).
Some basic git software content tracking (in order to fetch the project, modify and submit patches). 
The lilypond language (in order to edit or add tunes).
Some music knowledge would also help...:)

* Who currently contributes ?
Just me (Mark Veltzer <mark.veltzer@gmail.com>).

* Where can I see some results ?
Check out the PDFs and other outputs in http://veltzer.net/blog/music/.

* Why is there so little documentation ?
I just started this project. Feel free to add stuff and request a pull. If you contribute a lot I will make you an admin...

* Arent you supposed to produce a real book, meaning one file ?
Yes. I just haven't gotten around to it yet. Meanwhile you get one pdf per standard. Did I mention you can contribute ?

* How do you write the standards ?
Using lilypond. Check it out at: http://www.lilypond.org/

* Will you co-operate with the lilypond and the mutopia communities ?
YES! Any bugs or feature suggestion are submitted to the lilypond community. Any requests for pieces from the mutopia community will be respected.

* Do you only allow Jazz tunes ?
No. Rock and Pop will be welcome and so would classical. If you are really into classical lilypond production you may alternativly wish to contribute to the mutopia project at http://www.mutopiaproject.org/.

* How do I get started ?
create an account on git hub.
git checkout -b [your branch name] git://github.com/veltzer/openbook.git
make (install pieces of software that it needs if it complains).
hack on the files (git add the files that you hack on).
commit to your own hard drive repository (git commit).
push to git hub (git push).
request me to pull your changes (button in the github ui).
