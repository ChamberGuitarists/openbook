I just started this project. Feel free to add stuff and request a pull. If you contribute a lot I will make you an admin...

Yes. I just haven't gotten around to it yet. Meanwhile you get one pdf per standard. Did I mention you can contribute ?

Using lilypond. Check it out at: http://www.lilypond.org/

* Do you only allow Jazz tunes ?
No. Rock and Pop will be welcome and so would classical. If you are really into classical lilypond production you may alternativly wish to contribute to the mutopia project at http://www.mutopiaproject.org/.
