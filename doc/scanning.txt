This is a small guide on how to scan in ubuntu
==============================================

* why do you need this ?
because I want to scan real sheet music for reference.

* best program to use.
	xsane (you can just run it off the command line or via
		applications->graphics->xsane).
	settings:
		color, grey, lineart:
			lineart is bad (in terms of quality).
			I find grey is good for me.
	scan resolution: 100 usuallly is good enough.
