This documentation deals with how to create the final book
==========================================================
Options:
========
1. Create a pdf from every song and catenate them.
	A command line like this could do the trick:
	pdfjoin out/src/jazz/*.pdf --outfile '.$output.' 2> /dev/null

	Advantages:
	- very easy to do.
	Disadvantages:
	- cannot create nice index.
	- the resulting pdf is too heavy since it has the fonts over and over
	and over again.
		you can see this by issuing:
		> pdffonts out/src/jazz/once_i_loved.pdf
		and
		> pdffonts out/openbook.pdf
		and seeing that the object are repeated.
	- two tunes cannot occupy the same page (bigger book).
		I may not want, in a specific build, for two tunes
		to occupy the same page, but then again, I may want
		it (for printing for instance instead of digital
		book...).

2. Create a book using latex.
	TBD
3. Create a book using large lilypond file that includes all other
	lilyponds.
	TBD
