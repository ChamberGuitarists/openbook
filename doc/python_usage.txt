This document deals with which python version we use in openbook and why

We currently use python3.4

Why? 3 is better than 2 and 3.4 is really stable and mature.

Do we wish to enforce our selected version of python on the user?
- not really clear that we wish to enforce this specific version but for now we do.

How do we enforce our selected version?
- check_version.py used in every script.
- /usr/bin/python3.4 at SHBANG lines.
