This document deals with which python version we use in openbook and why

We currently use python3.4

Why? 3 is better than 2 and 3.4 is really stable and mature.

Do we wish to enforce our selected version of python on the user?
- At the shbang line we dont. That is why the shbang lines are #!/usr/bin/python3
- we do enforce by using check_version.py in every script. This needs to be reviewed.
