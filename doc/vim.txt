How to edit .mako files using the vim editor?
=============================================
- first make sure you have a ~/.vimrc file of your own.
	You can take /etc/vim/vimrc or /usr/share/vim/vim73/vimrc_example.vim
	or maybe even edit /etc/vim/vimrc (not recommended).
- add the next line in your ~/.vimrc:
	set runtimepath+=/usr/share/lilypond/2.14.2/vim/
	after this you can edit lilypond files with syntax highlighting.
- It seems that after the previous instructions .mako files also do lilypond
	highlighting. I don't really know why but I guess that the first
	two bullets are enough (I need to investigate this...)
