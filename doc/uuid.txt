UUID usage in this project:
===========================
- I'm using a unique id for each source file in order to not reimport these files
into the databse each time.
- I generate this uuid using the command line uuid(1) from the "uuid" package.
- The uuid is stored in the header of each file and is imported into the database.
- I recognize the tune by the uuid and not by any other means.
- I added the uuid to the table thus:
	alter table TbMsLilypond add uuid char(36) NOT NULL after id;
	alter table TbMsLilypond add key(uuid);
	* It seems that uuids are 36 characters long.
- if you want to reverese engineer a uuid then you can do
	uuid -d [uuid]
	from the command line.
