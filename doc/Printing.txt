Printing the results under Linux
================================
In general I recommend printing the postscript rather than the pdf. I find the pdf to be more coarse and less
accurate. The reason seems to be that the postscript is the real output of lilypond while the pdf is a secondary
format derived from that. Let me know if you think differently or have reservations about this observation.

Command line:
=============
To find out your default configured printer: lpstat -d. 
Make sure that that printer knows how to print postscript or pdf.

Command line printing:
Theoretically you could do "lp [file.ps]" or "lp [file.pdf]".
I found that the .ps and the .pdf stuff doesn't work for me.

Gnome:
======
if you open a file using "gnome-open" you are actually using "evince"
which is the gnome viewer.

Printing from the print menu of that software usually works.
