I made a descision to use a standalone preprocessor to process the files before giving them
to lilypond which means that source files are not the .ly files but rather the 'gpp' files.

Advantages:
- macro definitions in lilypond are complex and hard - a preprocessor is better.
- we can still have a single ly file per song/piece which makes it easier for people
to grab them from the project.
- we can have dependency analysis embedded in the build system which we don't get from lilypond.

Disadvantes:
- yet another technology in the project.
- people need to know how to use this preprocessor.
- source is no longer the lily files.
- another tool to install if you want to build the project.

What preprocessor to use?
=========================
gpp
	advantages:
	- has many options and configurable syntax.
	disadvantates:
	- usually needs to be installed.
	- does not do macro in macro very well.
	- does not emit dependency information very well.
cpp
	advantages:
	- widely available.
	disadvantates:
	- cannot handle single quotes (') well.
m4
	advantages:
	- has very good documentation (info m4 has lots and lots of info).
	- very well supported.
	- widely available.
	disadvantates:
	- does not know how to emit dependency information.
my own preprocessor
	advantages:
	- I can have it have any selection of features that I need.
	disadvantates:
	- need to be built (C, C++ ?)
