- download the sources from:
	http://download.linuxaudio.org/lilypond/sources/v2.14/
- untar.
- ./configure --prefix=/local/tools 
- install the missing packages.
	t2utils, texi2html, guide-1.8-dev and more.
- get to a situation where ./configure does not complain about anything.
- make all
- run make all a couple of times (the lilypond build system is not very clean).
- sudo make install

I have seen times when the version installed from source crashed on me in weird ways
and produced bad output. A better option seems to be to use the .sh installers provided
by the lilypond team.
