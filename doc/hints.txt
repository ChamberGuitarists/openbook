This is a set of lilypond hints:

Chords:
=======
- alternate bass to a chord: c2:m7/bes

- \chords is akin to \new ChordNames but with something else... What is it ?
	find out from the lilypond documentation...

- in order to put guitar chord notations just use:
	\include "predefined-guitar-fretboards.ly"
	\new FretBoards {
		\chordmode {
			[chords go here]	
		}
	}
  The problem with this is that you wind up repeating the chord names yet again just for the
  guitar diagrams. Find out how to avoid this...
	
speed of piece:
===============
- one way is:
	==== SNIP ====
	\tempo "Andante" 4 = 88
	==== SNIP ====
	at the top voice. This will create the right notation on the page
	AND determine the speed that the midi plays in.
	Advantages:
		- only one place that works for both print and midi, AND has the advantage
		of showing the right way in the print version.
	Disadvantages:
		- You need to map name of the speed to BPM or skip the BPM or name of speed
		entirely. You can use a lookup table like mine:
		http://veltzer.net/blog/blog/2010/08/14/musical-tempo-table/
- another way is:
	==== SNIP ====
	\context {
		\Score
		tempoWholesPerMinute = #(ly:make-moment 130 4)
	}
	==== SNIP ====
	at the midi section. This only determines the midi speed and has no effect on the
	print version.
	Advantages:
		- fine tuning the midi with no effect on other parts.
	Disadvantages:
		- can cause discrepency between the print version and the midi version. If
		you want to keep those two in sync without worrying you better use the \tempo
		method.

Lyrics
======
- breaking up lyrics
	eve -- ry day I write the book 
	eve - will be on the first note
	ry - will be on the second one.
- one syllable or word on a couple of notes
	I'm with you rain _ or shine!
	rain will be on two notes (rain _ _ will be places on three notes).

Midi production
===============
- if you have multiple scores in one file then you will need multipl \midi statements which
will lead to multiple midi files produced when that file gets processed.

- Is there a way to catenates all the midi files from within lilypond ? (tell lilypond that all midi should come out in a single midi file ?)
