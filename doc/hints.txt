- \chords is akin to \new ChordNames but with something else... What is it ?
	find out from the lilypond documentation...

- in order to put guitar chord notations just use:
	\include "predefined-guitar-fretboards.ly"
	\new FretBoards {
		\chordmode {
			[chords go here]	
		}
	}
  The problem with this is that you wind up repeating the chord names yet again just for the
  guitar diagrams. Find out how to avoid this...
