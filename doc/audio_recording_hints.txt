How to record sound on Linux:

arecord
	the most simple tool which ofcourse has no plugins, no condensors etc.

gnome-sound-recorder
	has no effects which means the sound is not very good.

ecasound
	seems to have a bunch of effects but I don't know how to run it.

ardour
	seems not to be able to access my webcam mic.
	need to test it some more.

audacity
	lets see.
