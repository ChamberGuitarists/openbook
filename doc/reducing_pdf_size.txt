The issue of pdf size is very important in this project since we want the smallest
possible pdf but with high quality.

Method 1 (BEST)
========
pdf2ps and then ps2pdf
It turns out we can reduce from ~9MB to 2MB this way!!!
We do lose links within the document but the quality does not seem to be diminished.

Method 2
========
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH  -dQUIET -sOutputFile=gs.pdf openbook.pdf
does not reduce the size of the file

Method 3
========
qpdf --linearize openbook.pdf qpdf.pdf
does not reduce the size

Method 4
========
convert openbook.pdf -compress Zip convert.pdf
Reduces the size by half but the output is ugly and pixelized.

Method 5
========
pdftk openbook.pdf output pdftk.pdf compress
does not reduce the size of the file
