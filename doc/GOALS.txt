Here are the goals for the 2.0 system:

- recursive parsing of the lilypond files by the perl parser
	(so that we would handle all header content properly and all recursive includes).
- completeness to be advertised in the db and the web.
- system to automatically create the table on the database if needed.
- many blobs per entry (ps, pdf, many pngs, ly) etc...
	import pngs too.
- all files to reach maturity level 2.
- all files have poet, copyright and all (checks are added to check_all).
- all hebrew songs are completely in hebrew.
- tags are added to the files and are inserted into the db.
