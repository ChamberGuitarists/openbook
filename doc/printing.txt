Here are some things I found out about the printing of lilypond produced
pdfs and ps files...

Printer settings
================
make sure that your printer settings (cups or administration from gnome or KDE) is right.
The most important part is the paper size - if you are using A4 then choose A4 (not A4
small by the way). If you do not do this then you will get various cut offs.
Make sure that the setting are ok both in cups and in gnome/KDE since the desktop layer
can override the cups layer.

Footers not printing
====================
There is a problem which sometimes appears in postscript prints from lilypond that make
the footer not print. I added this on each page to solve it:

#(set-default-paper-size "a4")
\paper {
	bottom-margin = 2.5\cm
}
The paper-size is not mandatory but that is what I use for printing. The bottom-margin
is mandatory since this is what makes the footer appear right.

Printing pdfs
=============
- If you use the gnome document viewer to print pdfs then make sure that your printing
definitions are right (see above).
- Alternativly use the command line "lp [filename]" (more control and less layers in the way).

Printing postscript
===================
- There is a problem with the footers not appearing (see above how this can be fixed).
- You can either use the gnome document viewer or the command line lp(1) (I prefer the latter).

which is better (postscript or pdf) ?
=====================================
Postscript: looks better. This is the original format which only then gets converted
to pdf so probably has other advantages. It is a little larger. Postscript format sometime
looses the footers if you do not use the "bottom-margin" trick mentioned above.
PDF: more portable, less weight, doesn't look as good as postscript.

Summary
=======
If you want the best quality then print the lilypond outputs using ** postscript ** from either the gnome document viewer or from the command line lp(1) (I prefer the latter for more determinism since it only takes preferences from the cups layer).
