Here are some policy descision:
===============================
- until a templating system is ready we are using straight lilypond files.
- until a configuration database is ready we are using lilypond includes to share data
	and to make it easy to change.
- all includes are root relative.
- some more checks are being made by the "make check_all" procedue which are also parts
	of the policy.
