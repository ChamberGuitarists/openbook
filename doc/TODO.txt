build system
============
- make each build make a temp folder so that I could build at the same time.

Lilypond cheet sheet
====================
- create a standards/lead sheet cheet sheet for lilypond.

Info addition
- add "poet="poetname"" header in all the pieces.
- add "copyright" header in all the pieces.

- get last changed date (the data of the *.ly file ?!?) and put it in the database
	on import. Show it in on the web.
	Enable a direct link to a files history from git from the web.

- demo page should show:
	- complex chords
	- chords with alternate bases.
	- matching lyrics to melody.

- add "todo" in all the pieces in the same style.
- add "completion level" in all the pieces. define completion levels and mark them out.
	put them in the database.
	show them on the php.
- add "tags" header in all the pieces (jazz, swing, bossa etc...).
- create midi,ps (multi rules in the makefile ?!?)
- make all of tunes have the same high level structure as "a_foggy_day.ly". This is much
	better because:
	- You don't have to have a stupid strucutre at the end which is replicated for each
	tune (or included).
	- Stuff gets in the sheet or out of it (tune, harmony, lyrics) according to whether
	it is there. When you add or remove stuff you just add or remove it - no need to update
	the master structure context.
	Record all of these understandings in some kind of standards document that I will
	start for all of this material.

- make a book with all of the standards.
	- how do I include all the files ? Should I write a script ?!?
- get number of pages and import that into the database too.
	How do we get it ?!?
	- count the number of pages in the pdf (some kind of pdf parser ?!?).
	- count the number of images created when --png is used.

- why doesn't the printing come out right ?!?
	- in pdf both the top and botton are sort of cut off.
	- postscript the bottom doesnt show.
