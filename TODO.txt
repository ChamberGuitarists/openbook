Info addition
- add "poet="poetname"" header in all the pieces.
- add "copyright" header in all the pieces.

- add "todo" in all the pieces in the same style.
- add "completion level" in all the pieces. define completion levels and mark them out.
	put them in the database.
	show them on the php.
- add "tags" header in all the pieces (jazz, swing, bossa etc...).
- create midi,ps (multi rules in the makefile ?!?)
- make all of tunes have the same high level structure as "a_foggy_day.ly". This is much
	better because:
	- You don't have to have a stupid strucutre at the end which is replicated for each
	tune (or included).
	- Stuff gets in the sheet or out of it (tune, harmony, lyrics) according to whether
	it is there. When you add or remove stuff you just add or remove it - no need to update
	the master structure context.
	Record all of these understandings in some kind of standards document that I will
	start for all of this material.
